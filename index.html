From the other graph, we can see that the United States has the most Municipal Waste recycled and this is because of population, strong recycling infrastructure, and government policies. The municipal waste of South Africa drops off in 2018 due to the Chinese ban of contaminated recyclables which South Africa had been taking advantage of. The economy of South Africa was also not doing well in 2018 which was another contributing factor.</p><div class =\'first-div\'>  <img src =\'GlobalFoodWasteTons.png\'> <img src = \'TotalMunicipalWasteRecycledTop5.png\'</div></div> ')" onmouseover = "document.getElementById('bottommargin').innerText='The total municipal waste of South Africa dropped off starting in 2018.
